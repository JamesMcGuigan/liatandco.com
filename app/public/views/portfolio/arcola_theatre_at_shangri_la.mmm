<h1>Glastonbury Festival: Arcola Theatre at Shangri-La</h1>
<h3 class="subheading">Role: Arts Coordinator</h3>

<p>Shangri-La is the after-hours epicentre of Glastonbury Festival, a largely indescribable, ephemeral and interactive world that really comes to life after dark. Following the general election, Shangri-La 2015 was animated with performers exploring an alternative and imagined political landscape.</p>
<p>We worked with selected members of the <a href="https://www.arcolatheatre.com/" target="_blank">Arcola Theatre's</a> intergenerational theatre group to create performances for Shangri-La's 'Prime Minister's Office'. This was accompanied by interactive walk about performances. The group explored the theme of political power through a series of workshops and through collaboration with the partner arts organisation in Holland.</p>
<p>The project was supported by Tandem Cultural Exchange, which supports long-term cooperation, knowledge development and networking opportunities between cultural managers across the EU and beyond.</p>
