<h1>Jerusalem Season of Culture</h1>
<h3 class="subheading">Role: Researcher</h3>

<p>The first part of a research project was undertaken as part of the <b>Artists' international development programme.</b> The host partner was the Jerusalem Season of Culture, a multi-artform festival consisting of smaller festivals and large-scale events. The annual festival commissions new work highlighting both the city and its artists. The research explored the festival framework as a vechicle for creativly connecting communities and fostering dialogue.</p>
